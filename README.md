## Guidelines

Welcome to the **Concrete Brand Guidelines**. They outline the visual and verbal identity of our brand. 
<b>

**LOGO**

Our logo is the primary identifier for our brand. It captures our name, mission, and legacy. It comes in a light version and a dark version. The light version has a slightly thicker stroker on the logo for legibility.

**ICON**

Concrete also utilizes an icon which is used as logo icon and PFP design.

**SCALING**

The logo has been carefully crafted to read well, even at small sizes. There is no limit at large scale, but be careful at smaller sizes. If legibility is an issue, it’s too small.

**CLEAR SPACE**

Don’t crowd the logo. When placing other elements nearby, ensure minimum clear space for brand consistency. Note how the clear space is calculated relative to a fixed element from the logo. See example below.

**DONT'S**

Do not diminish the value of the logo in our brand. Avoid the following treatments.
